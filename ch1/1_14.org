* Exercise 1.14:
  Draw the tree illustrating the process gen-
  erated by the count-change procedure of Section 1.2.2 in
  making change for 11 cents. What are the orders of growth
  of the space and number of steps used by this process as
  the amount to be changed increases?

** Answer
   Space complexity is O(n), time complexity is O(2^n)
