* Exercise 1.25: 
  Alyssa P. Hacker complains that we went to
  a lot of extra work in writing expmod. After all, she says,
  since we already know how to compute exponentials, we
  could have simply written
  #+BEGIN_SRC scheme
    (define (expmod base exp m)
    (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m))
  #+END_SRC
  Is she correct? Would this procedure serve as well for our
  fast prime tester? Explain.

** Answer
   No because for a sufficients large base and exp, having to calculate the
   remainder will become expensive. Whereas for the one we define, the
   remainder is computer intermediately.
